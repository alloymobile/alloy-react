# ⚙️ Alloy React Component Library

A modern, object-driven **React component library** designed for consistency, accessibility, and reusability — inspired by the Alloy Angular components.

All components use **object-based inputs** (`ButtonObject`, `LinkObject`, etc.) and expose full event-driven outputs for interactive UI development.
